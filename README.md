# 🕹️ Hangman Game

A fun and educational Hangman game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This version includes multiple difficulty levels, a countdown timer, a hint feature, and a responsive UI.  
🧑‍🏫 Built during the **General Assembly Bahrain** training program. I chose the Hangman game because it’s fun, educational, and a great way to practice JavaScript. It helped me improve my skills in logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction while building something engaging and interactive.
